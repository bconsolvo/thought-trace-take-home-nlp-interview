"DELAY IN MARKETING: In the event that Sublessee does not market producible gas, oil or their constituents from the Leasehold, or lands pooled/unitized therewith, Sublessee may continue to pay Delay Rental at the rate of Five Dollars ($5.00) per acre annually until such time as marketing is established, or until the end of the Sublease term, as it relates to the acreage described herein, if marketing is not established by that time. "
"UNITIZATION: Lessors grant Sublessee the right to pool, unitize, or combine all or any part of the Leasehold with any other land, leased or unleased, whether owned by Sublessee or others, to create drilling or production units either by contract right or pursuant to governmental authorization. In the event of the unitization of the whole or any part of the Leasehold, Sublessee shall, either before or after the completion of a well, record a copy of its unit operation designation in the county in which the Leasehold is located. Sublessee is granted the right to change the size, shape, and conditions of operation of any unit created, without the consent of Lessors. As to such a unit, Lessors agree to accept and receive out of the production or the proceeds from the production of such unit, such proportional share of the royalty from each unit well as the number of acres in the Leasehold which may be included from time to time in the unit bears to the total number of acres in the unit. Otherwise, the drilling, operations for drilling or any operations in preparation for drilling, or any production from a well on such a unit shall have the same effect upon the terms of this Lease, as amended and modified hereby, as if the operations or well were on this Leasehold itself, except for the FREE GAS clause, of which the Lessor acknowledges is hereby expressly released and terminated by this Lease Modification. "
"SHUT-IN: In the event that production of oil, gas, or their constituents is interrupted and not marketed for a period of six months, and there is no producing well on the Leasehold, or lands pooled/unitized therewith, Sublessee may thereafter, as Royalty for constructive production, pay a Shut-in Royalty equal in amount and frequency to the Delay Rental until such time as production is re-established and said payment shall maintain the above- referenced lease and modification in full force and effect to the same extent as payment of Royalty. During Shut-in, Sublessee shall have the right to rework, stimulate, or deepen any well on the Leasehold or drill a new well on the Leasehold in an effort to re-establish production, whether from an original producing formation or from a different formation. In the event that the production from the only producing well on the Leasehold is interrupted for a period of less than six months, the above-referenced Lease and Modification shall remain in full force and effect without payment of Royalty or Shut-in Royalty. "
"ROYALTY: Sublessee agrees to pay Lessor one-eighth of the net amount realized by Sublessee, calculated at the wellhead for actual volumes of oil, gas and their constituents sold (excluding storage gas) from said land. As used in this lease, the term ""net amount realized by Sublessee, calculated at the wellhead"" shall mean the gross proceeds received by Sublessee from the sale of oil, gas and their constituents sold (excluding storage gas) from said land, minus all post-production costs incurred by Sublessee between the wellhead and the point of sale. As used in this Lease, the term ""post-production costs"" shall mean all costs and expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Sublessee between the wellhead and the point of sale, accounted for in accordance with generally accepted industry principles, including but not limited to costs and expenses of (a) treating and processing oil, gas and/or their constituents and (b) separating liquid hydrocarbons from gas, other than condensate separated at the well and fractionation of the natural gas liquids, and (c) transporting oil, gas and/or their constituents, including but not limited to transportation between the wellhead and any production or treating facilities, and transportation to the point of sale, including any line loss, retainage or volume adjustments of any kind, and (d) compressing gas for transportation and delivery purposes, and (e) metering oil, gas and/or their constituents to determine the amount sold and/or the amount used by Sublessee, and (f) sales charges, commissions and fees paid to third parties (whether or not affiliated) in connection with the sale of the oil, gas and/or their constituents and (g) any and all other costs and expenses of any kind or nature incurred now or in the future whether or not such is specifically set forth herein with regard to the oil, gas and/or their constituents, or the handling thereof, between the wellhead and the point of sale. Sublessee may use its own pipelines and equipment to provide such treating, processing, separating, fractionation, transportation, compression and metering services, or it may engage others to provide such services; and if Sublessee uses its own pipelines and/or equipment, post-production costs shall include without limitation reasonable depreciation and amortization expenses relating to such facilities, together with Sublessee's cost of capital and a reasonable return on its investment in such facilities, accounted for in accordance with generally accepted industry principles. Prior to payment of royalty, Lessor may be required to execute a division order certifying Lessor's ownership interest in production. Sublessee may pay all taxes and fees levied upon the oil, gas and/or their constituents produced or the value or proceeds from the sale of such oil, gas and their constituents (excluding storage gas) from said lands, including, without limitation, excise, depletion, severance taxes, privilege and production taxes and surveillance fees that are now or hereafter levied or assessed or charged on oil, gas and their constituents hereby produced or the value or proceeds from the sale of such oil, gas and their constituents (excluding storage gas) from said lands, and deduct a proportionate share of the amount so paid from any monies payable to Lessor hereunder. It is agreed that any royalty conveyances in Lessor's chain of title shall be deducted from any monies payable to Lessor hereunder and that any royalty payments are subject to reduction pursuant to the Unitization provisions herein. Sublessee may withhold royalty payments until such time as the total withheld exceeds fifty dollars ($50.00). "
